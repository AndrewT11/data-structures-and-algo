- Hash Tables

* Hash Intro
  Run Key:value pairs through a hash.

Only the key that gets run through the hash. Each letter has an ascii numerical value. The hash will run those numbers through a math equaltion and create a number.

Two characteristics of hashes:

1. One way. A string can create a hash. The has cannot create a string.
2. Determistics. Once a hash is produced from a key, the same hash will always be produced from that key.
